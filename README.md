# What is BETA
BETA is essentially the percentage the stock market goes up, ie; 1% BETA of 1.20 means that it reflects the market 1:1 + 20%.

# Lowering risk
If you overweight a certain sector, with buying people with a lower beta you have a low risk portfolio.

# Overloading / Underloading
If you increare your exposure in a sector relative to an index like sp500, you are overloading, if you decrease the weight you are underloading

# Index weighting
Price weighting = yesterdays value vs todays value, its a positive or negative increase, starting point for DOW is the divisor.
When the DOW has a established original price point it has a blackbox calculation. It is a price weighted index, based on yesterdays pricing vs todays pricing.

# Weighted index
SP500, TSX and NASDAQ are value weighted indexes.

# Unweighted index
Each and every stock will be allocated be 0.2%, SP500 is unweighted index?
