# What is BETA
BETA is essentially the percentage the stock market goes up, ie; 1% BETA of 1.20 means that it reflects the market 1:1 + 20%.

# Lowering risk
If you overweight a certain sector, with buying people with a lower beta you have a low risk portfolio.

# Overloading / Underloading
If you increare your exposure in a sector relative to an index like sp500, you are overloading, if you decrease the weight you are underloading

# Index weighting
Price weighting = yesterdays value vs todays value, its a positive or negative increase, starting point for DOW is the divisor.
When the DOW has a established original price point it has a blackbox calculation. It is a price weighted index, based on yesterdays pricing vs todays pricing.

# Weighted index
SP500, TSX and NASDAQ are value weighted indexes.

# Unweighted index
Each and every stock will be allocated be 0.2%, SP500 is unweighted index? 

# Fixed Income Market
Walmart level of investing, buy 1000 of cibc's fixed income assset that will pay 5% apy for 10y.
Or you can pay someone to do it, lol

## How to determine to buy a stock
- Look at requirements and break them down

# Rules of thumb
- don't ever put 5% of a port into an individual stock
- Calculator allowed
- 75% theory, 25% calculation
- Same pool of questions that will be on the midterm and final

# Calculating Average
Example;

Day 1 - 100
Day 2 - 102
Day 3 - 101
Day 4 - 105
Day 5 - 98

Caluclating Average

100+102+101+105+98 / 5 = 101.2


- How can we protect downside of the investment
- Use stuff like standard deviation

Flotation costs = cost to go into the market and raising capital

## Step 2, find each prices dev from the average
- 100 - 101.2 = -1.2
- 102 - 101.2 = 0.8
- 101 - 101.2 = -0.2
- 105 - 101.2 = 3.8
- 98 - 101.2 = -3.2

### Standard deviation
- 1 SD = 68%
- 2 SD = 95%
- 3 SD = 99.73%

#### Calculating SD
- -1.2^2 = 1.44
- 0.8^2 = 0.64
- -0.2^2 = 0.04
- 3.8^2 = 14.44
- -3.2^2 = 10.24

#### Caclulating varience (VAR)
- Need to deduct one period, example, if you're analyzing 5 days, you need to do 5-1
- 1.44+0.64+0.04+14.44+10.24/5-1 = 26.8/4 = 6.7
- Now you need to square root 6.7, = 2.59
- 2.59 =  SD

# Anti Correlation Stocks
- For Example, NG Comapnies v Potash companies
- Input for potash is natural gas, therefore potash companies go down in value, natural gas companies stock goes up

# Correlation Stocks
- Stock A kind of tracks Stock B

# Calculating Correlation
Apple stock / MSFT Stock in same time period
1. A: 2, M: 1
2. A: 4, M: 3
3. A: -1, M:-2
4. A: 3, M: 2
5. A: 0, M: 1

## Calculate average return
Apple = 2+4+-1+3+0 / 5 = 1.6
MSFT = 1+3+-2+2+1 / 5 = 1

## Compute Deviation
- Take the price - the average
- Square it
- 
## Calculate Covarianece




## Calculate Correlation
Standard deviation
Apple - 2.11
MSFT - 1.8

3.5 / (2.1*1.8) = 0.93
Correlation min = -1, max = 1
